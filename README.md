# Digital-Clock-using-Verilog-Programming-NEXYS-4
This project based on NEXYS-4 ARTIX-7 FPGA board. We use Verilog programming language. Our purpose to show Digital Clock on FPGA board in HOURS: MIN: SEC.
The NEXYS-4 ARTIX-7 FPGA board is largely used by the digital clock to digitally show the time. 
By default, the digital clock shows the run time; to alter the time, use the time preset on the switch on board. 
The digital clock is created using the 24-hour format. 
The manner in which the time is shown inhours:minutes:seconds.
In this project, the digital clock can display the time in 12- or 24-hour modes. 
It can be used to keep time in a variety of locations, including the kitchen, office, and bedroom.
The different components that can be utilised to build the digital clock include an FPGA, a microcontroller, and simple logic circuits. 
The digital clock can be set up to show time in a variety of ways, such as a simple numerical display or a more complex display that combines numerous graphical elements. 
The digital clock can also be programmed to play a variety of sounds, including chimes, alarms, and others.
